Refine LLM Interaction (if using a mock): If the output was from the mock LLMInterface within basic_runtime.py, the next step would be to ensure the actual OpenRouterLLM from engine.llm_services.llm_interface.py is used and that it produces good results with real API calls. This involves making sure your .env is correct and that the prompt in RuntimeCognitiveCore is effective for a real LLM.
Expand Action Repertoire & Validation: The LLM suggested "pray." You'll want to expand the list of possible actions the LLM can choose and implement more robust validation for those actions in the CognitiveCore or an ActionManager.
Action Execution: Currently, the chosen action is just printed. The next step for the RuntimeActor would be to send this action to a basic ActionManager (as per Phase I, item #6 of the blueprint) which would then determine the effect of the action (e.g., updating the Actor's state or the environment).
Agno Agent Framework Integration: Start integrating the RuntimeActor class with the Agno agent framework as planned. This will involve mapping our current perceive and decide_and_act logic into Agno's lifecycle methods.
More Complex Perceptions: Move from simple string perceptions to more structured perception data, potentially using the PerceptionManager (Phase I, item #5).
Iterative Loop: Develop a proper simulation loop that allows the actor to take multiple turns, process new perceptions based on previous actions, and continue the narrative.
